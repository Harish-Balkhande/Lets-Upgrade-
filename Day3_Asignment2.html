Q. Write the difference between var,let & const with code examples.
Ans:
1.var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while 
  let and const are block scoped.
2.var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; 
  let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables
  can neither be updated nor re-declared.
3.They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables
  are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
4.While var and let can be declared without being initialized,
  const must be initialized during declaration.

<html>
    <head>
        <title>var,let & const</title>
        <h2>Difference Between var, let & const</h2>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script type="text/javascript">
        var name = "Satish Pandey";
        var city = "Nagpur";

        {
            let fruit = "Banana";
            console.log({fruit,name,city}); //var is having global scope
        }
        //can't print out of block, since let is block scoped
        //console.log(fruit);

        const weight =55;
        //if const variable are not initialised while declearation , gives an error
        //const flower;
        console.log(weight);

        console.log(name,city);        
        </script>
