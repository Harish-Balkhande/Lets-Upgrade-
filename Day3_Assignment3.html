Q. Write a brief intro on available data types in javascript.
Ans:-
    There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.
number :-
         for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.
bigInt :-
        bigInt is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
string :-
        for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
boolean :-
        for true/false.
null :-
        for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
undefined :-
        for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
object :-
        for more complex data structures.
symbol :-
        for unique identifiers.  

Note − Use the var keyword only for declaration or initialization, once 
for the life of any variable name in a document. You should not re-declare
same variable twice.
    JavaScript is untyped language. This means that a JavaScript variable
can hold a value of any data type. Unlike many other languages, you don't
 have to tell JavaScript during variable declaration what type of value the
variable will hold. The value type of a variable can change during the execution
of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.
